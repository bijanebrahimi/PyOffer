# PyOffer

a Graphical tool to track special offers on the Internet.

## Install

Note: Installation requires you to install `pyqt5` package first. I hope we can
add it later to setup process, but for now first install it manually and then:

```
git clone git@github.com:bijanebrahimi/PyOffer.git
cd pyoffer
python setup.py install
```

## Run

By installing the package, `pyoffer-gui` should be available from terminal.

```sh
$ pyoffer-gui
```
